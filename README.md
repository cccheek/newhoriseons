# newhoriseons

1. The first thing I changed was the title to read "Welcome to Horiseon!" because it's friendlier than "webpage".

2. I spaced out the h1, h2 and h3 tags to make them easier to read.

3. I added alt tags to photos.

4. Spaced out individual sections for better readability.

5. I grouped different commands for the same section that were split.
