# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

1. I started by copying and pasting all of the starter code that was provided.
2. I then added alts to all images and icons, because that was the easiest thing to start with the first time around and I didn't want to forget about them.
3. I then changed the title to "Welcome to Horiseon!" because it's more welcoming than "webpage".
4. I then started replacing repetitive divs with more specific semantic tags. For example; header, nav, aside, section and footer.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
